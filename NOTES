NOTES:
    The file path input part from task file was unclear.
    In the example of the given task there are non valid strings, specifically with numbers and these lines are also present in ordering part as well, so`
        in case of number length it can also be 0, so basically the number is absent, then how can a line with invalid line number part be present in ordering part?
    It is not clear if the lines with empty surname should always appear in the end, either when ordering is ascending or descending.

IMPROVEMENTS:
    could be done:
        Generators for big content file loading
        reduce the usage with global keyword
        lines could be wrapped as class instances and they could as well be manipulated by another class
        code could be more conceptual to functional programming paradigm
        functions could have docstring to be more describable
