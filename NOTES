The file path input part from task file was unclear.

In the example of the given task there are non valid strings, specifically with numbers and these lines are also present in ordering part as well, so`
    in case of number length it can also be 0, so basically the number is absent, then how can a line with invalid line number part be present in ordering part?


could be done via:
